                            UBOAT<br>

                            UBOAT is a simulator of a submarine from WWII era, yet different than all you have seen so
                            far. It is a survival sandbox with crew management mechanics while its primary theme is life
                            of German sailors. The boat is their home, but it can become their grave at any time.
                            In UBOAT you control the crew in order to control the boat. You look after their physical
                            and mental health, because if the sailors are hungry, tired and their spirit is low,
                            thereâ€™s no chance of winning even a skirmish.<br><br>

                            Survival<br>

                            The extensive damage system is a foundation of the gameâ€™s survival elements. Unprecedented
                            situations are bound to happen as the effect of received damage, testing playerâ€™s
                            creativity and ability to stay calm. You can try to save the whole crew or leave someone
                            behind, to save the others.<br>
                            While your ship travels through the open seas, you will often find yourself being on your
                            own. Use your management skills to spend resources taken on the trip optimally and in
                            special cases try to recover them on the sea, by asking your allies for the helpâ€¦ or by
                            looting wreckages of enemy ships.<br>
                            * Disable unnecessary devices, to keep your accumulators running for longer.<br>
                            * Tell your crew to stay in their bunks to preserve oxygen.<br>
                            * If crewâ€™s morale is low â€“ play with them a session of Skat or play music from nearby
                            radio stations, to fortify their hearts.<br><br>

                            Kriegsmarine career<br>

                            During the playthrough you will receive assignments from the Kriegsmarine headquarters. They
                            are never linear and you may receive additional orders during them or face unexpected
                            problems.<br>
                            Brave completion of assignments from the headquarters is rewarded with additional budget for
                            the unit under your command and with acceptance of your growing reputation as an u-boatâ€™s
                            skipper. You will need that, to upgrade your ship and keep up with enemyâ€™s technological
                            advances.<br>
                            * Upgrade your boat for the rewarded funds.<br>
                            * Receive additional permissions for the reputation points.<br>
                            * Buy new equipment â€“ new torpedo types, sonar decoys, CO2 absorbers and much more.<br>
                            * Send your officers on special tasks in the headquarters to, among other things, speed up a
                            research of new technologies.<br><br>

                            Accurate simulation<br>

                            Gameâ€™s simulation elements are very realistic, but that never comes at a cost of gameplay
                            quality. Despite extensive simulation elements, UBOAT can be played like a regular game and
                            complex matters can be learned later to become a better skipper for the commanded unit.<br>
                            Even small things like the influence of ballast in each compartment on the shipâ€™s trim
                            (tilt) or Earthâ€™s curvature are faithfully reproduced in the game.<br>
                            Perfection can be achieved in many ways. Prove your management skills and swiftly assign
                            work to your officers to speed things up. If, on the other hand, you think that if something
                            needs to be done, itâ€™s better to do that on your own â€“ sit behind the periscope,
                            hydrophone or 88 mm deck gun and take matters in your own hands.<br></p>
